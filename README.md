This is a personal project built out of curiosity.
It's functional, but there was no intention to share this code during its development, reason why there is low inflexibility in coding best practices; it mainly serves as support for the text on fractals available at the link below.

If you want to reproduce the results, select an interpreter that has matplotlib, numpy, and imageio libs installed, access the src/dragon_curve_drawing file, and run it to generate a new gif inside /src/images. From that you can alter the parameters (like colors or number of curves) to get new images.
